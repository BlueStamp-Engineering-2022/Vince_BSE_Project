# Computer Vision Object Tracking Robot

My project is a robot that uses the OpenCV Python library to track and follow a ball of uniform color through the Raspberry Pi camera.

This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project

My starter project was a custom Arduino project. For this project, I chose a pushbutton as my input and an LED as my output. Since this was essentially the first time I had worked with circuits, initially, I just individually followed the official Arduino tutorials for the pushbutton and the LED to get a basic understanding for how to wire circuits on a breadboard and what resistors to use for the individual components. Afterwards, I used the knowledge I had gained from the tutorials to think of an original way to wire on the breadboard so that I could control the LED with the pushbutton. I faced a few struggles with my original pushbutton not working and figuring out how wiring worked, but it was a good experience that allowed me to learn a lot more about wiring and Arduinos.
